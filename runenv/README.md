# ForgeGradle Multiproject Run Environment

This repository provides a run environment template for multiproject development environments using ForgeGradle.

In most cases none of these files will need to be modified in any way.  
It is a template in the sense that it can be extended, but it should cover most use cases by default.

This repository on its own will **NOT** result in a multiproject development environment.  
It **MUST** be paired with a root buildscript like the one found [here](https://github.com/amadornes/fg-multiproject-template).  
Setup instructions can be found in the aforementioned repository.

## Known issues
 - Access transformers are not supported

## Currently untested
 - Mixin support

## Contributions
Pull requests adding extended feature support and bugfixes are welcome.  
Please keep them simple if possible.
